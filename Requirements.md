# Implemnting GREP using Naive Search Agorithm

This involves coming up with a naive search algorithm based version of grep and
use this to: 

Perform performance analysis on codes of both approaches:
The text files have been provided and your task will be to run the grep command of both
approaches on these files **all at once **. Separate execution on each file will result in deduction of
marks. Analysis can be done through comparing run-times in milliseconds. 
#### If no string is found then display a message of no string found.

### Example Output:
```
> grep 'said' *.txt
Your algorithm: 600 ms
Naive algorithm: 1500 ms
```
You must perform your **searches** for the following texts in this part:

1. “Medea knew the juice would make things grow”
2. “he died Jason was king”
3. “they could have walked past us”
4. “How big your eyes are, grandma”


Explain how your approach is performing better than the Naive approach. Give
explanation in points not paragraph and keep it concise.
